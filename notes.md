### Questions we can answer with image analysis
1. signal intensity under different conditions of cells, tissues
2. number of cells in a field
3. characterization of tissues

- an image is just a matrix of numbers

## Pixels
Picture element
- they are basically tiny boxes that can be looked at as numbers when really zoomed in

Properties of image
- pixel size: width height and depth of the images (as individual squares)
- resolution: measure of how close objects can be in an image is called spatial resolution
- images are stored as bits in microscopy: 8,12,16 bits
    -- 8 bit images: 256 pixels (gray values; 0-255)

On the software
- look up tables: how image is displayed on the screen - pixel values to colors
    -- different LUK have different colors - gray, rgb, green etc; the image will be colored different but will have the same pixel value

Histogram
- basically summary of images
